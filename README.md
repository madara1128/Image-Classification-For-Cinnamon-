# 🌿 Ceylon vs Cassia Cinnamon - Image Classification

This project uses deep learning to classify images of **Ceylon Cinnamon** and **Cassia Cinnamon** using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 📁 Dataset Source

This dataset was created by me and published on Kaggle:

🔗 [Ceylon and Cassia Cinnamon – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madaraweerasingha/ceylon-and-cassia-cinnemon)

It contains image samples of:
- 🌱 Ceylon Cinnamon (true cinnamon)
- 🌰 Cassia Cinnamon (commercial substitute)

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- 🔍 Classify cinnamon images as either **Ceylon** or **Cassia**
- 🔒 Help in verifying authentic Sri Lankan cinnamon
- 🧠 Improve accuracy using image-based ML models

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 🛠️ Key Features
